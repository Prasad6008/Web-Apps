Todo List Web Application:
A simple, interactive Todo List app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The application also supports storing tasks in the browser's local storage so that tasks persist even after refreshing the page. Additionally, users can edit or delete individual tasks or clear all tasks at once.

Features:

Add tasks to the Todo list.
Edit tasks by double-clicking on them.
Delete individual tasks or all tasks at once.
Tasks persist through page reloads using local storage.
Responsive user interface.
Scrollable task list when overflowed.
Dynamic visibility of "Delete All" button (hidden when no tasks are present).

How It Works:

Enter a task in the input box and click "Add" to add it to the list.
The task will appear in the list below. Double-clicking the task allows you to edit or delete it.
You can edit the task by modifying the text in the popup editor and clicking "Submit."
The "Delete All" button allows you to clear all tasks at once.
The scrollbar in the task list is hidden by default but becomes active when the content overflows.

Technologies Used :

🔰 HTML
🔰 CSS (including pseudo-elements for scroll management)
🔰 JavaScript (for DOM manipulation and local storage)

Installation :

Clone the repository.

How to Run :

After adding tasks, they will automatically be stored in the browser's local storage.
To edit or delete a task, double-click on the task and use the editor pop-up.
The "Delete All" button appears only when there are tasks in the list.
